      Successfully released to CPAN a couple of days ago and finally
      managed to see what the POD looks like.  YIKES!  This inspired
      two modifications:
      - Immediately set to correcting typos and unclear remarks in the POD.
        (I doubt it's perfect now.)
      - Added method Yapp_negate_roots(), which produces a polynomial whose
        roots are the negatives of the given polynomial.
