Revision history for Perl extension Math::Yapp.

1.01  Wed Apr 17 23:46:36 2013
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -XA -n Math::Yapp

    This is the first release.  No changes to report.

1.02  Sun Oct 06 23:33:28 2013 
      Successfully released to CPAN a couple of days ago and finally
      managed to see what the POD looks like.  YIKES!  This inspired
      two modifications:
      - Immediately set to correcting typos and unclear remarks in the POD.
        (I doubt it's perfect now.)
      - Added method Yapp_negate_roots(), which produces a polynomial whose
        roots are the negatives of the given polynomial.  (I hadn't realized
        that omission until I read the POD.)

1.03  Mon Oct 14 11:20:12 2013 
      - Commented out [use Math::BigFLoat;] and the call to
        Math::BigFLoat->accuracy() in the BEGIN block.  This because the
        BUGS section of Math::Complex warns me not attempt to use BigFloat.
        I left these stantements in there as comments as a reminder that I
        need to do something about the accuracy; 64 (or 80?)-bit floats
        don't quite cut it for polynomials above degree 8.

        Yes, this leaves a no-op BEGIN block.  But who knows what I'll come
        up with in a future release?
